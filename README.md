# Node.js with Express Movie Rating System

This is an application I build to help me learn Express. Instead of using 'express-generator', I wrote everything manually and commented as I went to make sure I had a good understanding of what the code means. 

I used Grunt, Sass, Node.js, EJS for templates, express-session for sessions, bcrypt for user authentication, Express, MongoDB, and Monk.
